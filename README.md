# PUBLIC ART TRACKER
This is a single page web-app built to simplify the discovery of public domain artwork
which enjoys the Freedom of Panorama (FOP). It is built to enable the user to include 
any number of external sources of data.

If you find this project somewhat useful then feel free to add bugreports and feature requests.

## Example data source
