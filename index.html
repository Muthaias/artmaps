			<h1>City Safe Art Maps</h1>
			<h3>Enjoy a selfie-safe art tour in any city</h3>
			<p>Say cheese! You may take photos with your smartphone of all the publicly displayed works of art in this tour.
				However, if the artist is still alive, or if less than 70 years have passed since he or she passed away, you
				may not share these digital photos publicly, e.g. by sharing them on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. If the
				artist passed away 70 or more years ago the work has fallen into the public domain and you may share your
				pictures in anyway you please.
			</p>
			<h3>Why is this?</h3>
			<p>Freedom of panorama (FOP) is a provision in the copyright laws of various jurisdictions that permits taking
				photographs
				and video footage and creating other images (such as paintings) of buildings and sometimes sculptures and
				other art
				works which are permanently located in a public place, without infringing on any copyright that may
				otherwise subsist
				in such works, and the publishing of such images. (<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama">Wikipedia</a>, 2018)
			</p>
			<p>A recent court case in Sweden decided that one is <em>not allowed</em> to share photographs of public art
				with the public
				through the internet. It does not matter whether the purpose is commercial or not.
				The court case was between Wikimedia Sweden and BUS (a Swedish collective management organisation for
				picture artists).
